## 📌 Overview

Driver fatigue poses a critical threat to railway transportation safety, especially in long-duration train driving scenarios.  
This project presents a **vision-based driver fatigue detection framework** built upon a **Dynamic Swin-CRM contrastive self-supervised learning strategy**, aiming to alleviate the limitations of feature representation capability and the strong reliance on annotated data in existing approaches.

The proposed framework leverages **self-supervised and contrastive learning** to exploit unlabeled data for learning discriminative fatigue-related visual representations.  
A **deformable window masking mechanism** is introduced to enhance hierarchical and multi-scale feature modeling.  
In addition, a **fatigue mathematical generation model** is incorporated to characterize the temporal evolution of fatigue and provide **continuous, physiologically plausible supervisory signals**.
